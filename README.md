# Breadboard-Power-Supply-Module-AMS1117-Based-
A compact breadboard-compatible regulated power supply built using the AMS1117-5.0 linear voltage regulator.  This module converts an external 9V DC input into a stable 5V output, suitable for Arduino, STM32, ESP8266, and other embedded development boards.  Designed for rapid prototyping and lab experiments.

Circuit Explanation
The AMS1117 regulates the input voltage down to a stable 5V output.

Capacitors are added:

1)At the input → to smooth supply variations
2)At the output → to stabilize the regulator
3)0.1µF capacitors → for high-frequency noise filtering
Without proper capacitors, the output voltage may drop (observed ~4.6–4.7V under load).

Limitations

1)Not efficient for high current applications
2)Generates heat at higher loads
3)Not suitable for long-term battery operation
4)Requires proper input-output voltage difference (dropout voltage consideration)
